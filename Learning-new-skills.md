## Learning New Skills
there's two ways of learning: tutorials, creating projects. Both have usings, if you have no idea about the code enviroment of the thing you want to learn (say you were laravel developer and learning node) it's better to see tutorials or courses. But if you're familiar with the code enviroment, it'll be faster to make a project to learn it.

### Learning by courses
I've listed some of youtube creators that you'll find almost everything you want to learn in their channels.

##### Method
1. Finding the tutorial/crash course: you have to find the newest tutorial that fits you.
2. how to watch:
  a. Watch it on x1.25 to x1.75 (Maybe x2 if the tutor was talking slomo).
  b. No need for long breaks, 5 to 10 secs is very enough
3. the legendary way to take breaks:
  a. between chapters, 5 to 10 secs. Empty your mind, think nothing.
  b. in the middle of the chapter, 10 to 15 secs. Think about previous chapter, rewind the whole idea
4. If you know the thing that he's explaining, skip it, BUT be careful that you don't skip new ideas.
5. Apply the things you learned (without a project) after you finish the a lesson or the whole course. Just redo what the tutor did.
6. After you finish the course, go to chatGPT and write: (Change NODE)
```
Give me a Hard project idea to create with `NODE` that covers every single topic in it. Please note that I'm not familiar with so many related technologies so please don't include other advanced technologies keeping the project's diffuclty the same
```
if you didn't like the idea, send this:
```
Give me a bit harder and more creative idea
```
7. Search for best practices and how professionals get things done.
8. Search for this idea built in open sources so you understand how it get done. It would be harder but better to do it yourself only with the number 8
9. Build some great projects to place in your portfolio
10. WORK, nothing teaches you like real projects and a harsh manager.


##### Notes
1. youtube is enough! you don't need paid courses, they'll be helpful more than youtube because they probably have the whole thing explained in the videos, but you can still learn them later, no need to waste money.
2. Don't listen to the "learning duration" on the internet. Personally I've learned html in 3 months, laravel in 2 days, nodeJS in 5 hours.
3. You should finish ASAP
4. You have to gather all the fundemential topics from the course, because if you missed something and learned it later, you'll miss the oppurtunity of practicing that thing for a long time.
5. DO NOT depend on one course or tutorial, you also have to visit the docs, other tutorials, maybe asking ChatGPT for the things that you might have missed
6. Don't apply what you have learned directly, the best way to watch everything then apply them.
7. if you don't have that strong memory, apply every lecture.
8. Join hackerrand, codewars, or leetcode to get advanced, learn details, learn tricks in that technology.
9. as I always say, everything in live has its black market. There's too many hacks to get things done rather than sticking to the dorky coding way, if you're building a blog or e-commerce for some loser trying to be jeff bezos, no need to waste your time coding repetitve things, join web geeks server to learn more about the black market.
10.




### Learning by courses
it's simpler...




### Other Notes
1. Join that tech's community. Web Geeks will help you
2. watch 1 or 2 project building
3. download elite-code-quality projects of this tech and steal their way of getting things done
4. explore pupolar tools used with that tech and learn them
